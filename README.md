Women-safety-app  based on flutter  
We used flutter to develop an women safety app in which register/login and add favourite contacts needed backend which is done using sqllite. We made a ai chat service using gemini api. we made sms alert to favourite contacts using sms dependencies.

To run this app you need either android studio or vs code with flutter setup.
